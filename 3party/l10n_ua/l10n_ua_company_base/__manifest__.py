Ukraine - Company Registration Data
===================================

The registration details a Ukrainian company is identified by, on `res.company`:

* **EDRPOU** — the state register code, quoted on every document and in every
  report filed with a state body.
* **KOATUU** and **KATOTTG** — the administrative-territorial codes; KATOTTG
  is required by the unified PIT/military-levy/USC report.
* **Tax office code** (ДПІ) and **Pension fund office code** (ПФУ) — where the
  company files.
* **Main KVED**, **ownership form**, **legal address**.

None of this is HR data, accounting data or tax data in particular — it is who
the company *is*, and the payroll reports, the tax cabinet, the bank exports
and the printed forms all need it. Keeping it in a module that depends on
nothing but `base` means a tax or accounting installation can read it without
pulling in the HR block, and an HR installation without pulling in accounting.
