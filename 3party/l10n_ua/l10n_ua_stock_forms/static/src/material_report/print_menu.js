 * the counter of selected rows, that is, it requires ticking them first. What
 * people want to print is what is already on screen, so the entry is added to
 * the permanent cog and the current search domain is sent to the server. It
 * carries both the control panel filters and the narrowing done with the
 * left-hand panel, so the paper repeats the screen.
