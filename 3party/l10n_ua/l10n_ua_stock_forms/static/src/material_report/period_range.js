 * to the "from" date, so changing a date does not narrow the displayed rows
 * but makes the server recompute the report. That is why the dialog writes the
 * dates onto the wizard and the view is reloaded afterwards, instead of
 * touching the search domain.
 *
 * The dialog is a plain form with the standard `daterange` widget rather than
 * a calendar of our own. Two ordinary date fields cannot collapse into a
 * single day by a stray click, and a form footer is the confirmation everyone
 * already knows — the custom popover needed a hand-made Apply button because
 * DateTimePicker hides its footer for plain dates.
 *
 * The dates are read from the wizard rather than from the action context: the
 * context is fixed at the moment the report opens and, after the very first
 * change of period, would show a stale value when switching List ↔ Pivot.
