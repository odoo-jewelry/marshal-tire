"""Migrate legacy employee addresses onto the Odoo 19 private_* address.

This script runs on a large and varied installed base, so it makes no
assumptions beyond "the module is being upgraded": every legacy column is
probed before use, every statement is idempotent, and no statement can
overwrite an address a customer already keeps in the native fields.

The one rule the whole script is built around: **nothing is ever lost.**
registration_same_as_actual is only left enabled where mirroring the private
address onto the registration block cannot destroy a differing value; wherever
the two addresses actually disagree the flag is cleared and both survive
side by side, for the HR officer to reconcile.
