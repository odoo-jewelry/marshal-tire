        moved the staff unit and left the money alone — the staffing table said
        the post was free from July while the surcharge went on being paid

        by an earlier activation — stays closed exactly as the cancellation
        left it, and only `action_activate` opens it again. Without this the

        clearing `date_to` or correcting the percentage on a drafted

        cancelling a combination that ran out last spring does not revive it
