"""Distribution of the Ukrainian working schedules to companies.

The core ``res.company._create_resource_calendar()`` gives every company its
own default calendar. This applies the same pattern to the ten statutory
regimes from ``data/resource_calendar_ua_data.xml``: each company gets its own
copy of every schedule.

Copies rather than one shared record per database is a deliberate choice:
``resource.calendar`` has a single ``company_id``, so while a schedule is
shared it can only belong to one company, and changing that field silently
switches it for all the others. The price is 10 x N records, which have to be
edited per company whenever the labour law changes.
