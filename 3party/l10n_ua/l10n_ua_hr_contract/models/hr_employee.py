    # 'version_id'}`), never through `current_version_id`.
    #
    # `version_id` is a compute with `@api.depends_context('version_id')`:
    # the versions timeline widget puts the version being looked at into the
    # context, and the whole card follows it. Pointed at `current_version_id`
    # instead, these fields kept showing today's version while the native
    # ones switched — and an edit made in that state was written to today's
    # version rather than the one on screen.
    #
    # The groups are stated even though a related field already borrows them
    # from its target (`Field._related_groups`), so deleting these declarations
    # would not have opened the fields up. They are written out because core
    # asks for it on every version field carrying a group
    # (`addons/hr/models/hr_employee.py:178`) and because `hr.tests.
    # TestPayrollFieldsAccess.test_related_fields_on_version` reads them off the
    # declaration: a group that only exists by inheritance is a group nobody
    # sees when reading this file. They mirror `hr.version` one for one.

        Deliberately not `compute_sudo`. The reference date needs
        `contract_date_start` / `contract_date_end`, which core restricts to
        hr.group_hr_manager, and an HR officer who may not read them still
        needs the panel — so exactly those two reads are elevated, and nothing
        else. The resolution runs under the user: its record rules apply, and a
        line they may not see is simply not found, because a search returns
        fewer rows rather than raising.

        That buys a property a blanket sudo cannot: whatever the resolution
        returns, the reader is entitled to read. The fields fed from it can
        then be read plainly, with no risk of an access error on a form.

        `depends_context('version_id')` because `date_version`, `job_id`,
        `department_id` and `contract_date_*` are all delegated to the version
        and therefore answer differently under the timeline's context. A
        related field picks that up on its own — `Field.get_depends()` walks
        the path and collects the context keys of every step — but a compute
        gets only what its own decorators declare. Without it the cache key
        is the same in every context, so whichever version was read first in
        the transaction wins and the panel shows, next to the position, the
        line and salary of a version that is not the one on screen.
