"""Give every company its own set of UA working schedules.

Until this version the ten schedules from the data file were created without
a company_id and therefore inherited it from the field default, i.e. whichever
company happened to be active while the module was installed. One record per
database meant the schedule belonged to exactly one company while employees of
the other ones pointed at a foreign schedule: their "Working Hours" field
showed another company, and the obvious fix - changing company_id on the
schedule itself - switched it for everyone at once.

Here those ten records become templates (no company, archived), every company
gets its own copy of every schedule, and all references are repointed to the
copy of their own company.

    Built from the live foreign keys rather than a hard-coded list: which
    tables exist depends on the installed modules, and missing one of them
    leaves records pointing at an archived template - a leave sitting on the
    template is invisible to _leave_intervals_batch, which filters by
    calendar_id, so it silently stops being subtracted from the working time.

    Only tables carrying a company_id qualify - that column is what tells us
    which copy the row belongs to. This excludes resource_calendar_attendance
    (the working hour lines belong to the calendar itself) and res_company,
    which is handled separately.

    resource_calendar_leaves is excluded for the same reason as the attendance
    lines, even though it does carry a company_id: that column is a stored
    compute over calendar_id.company_id (addons/resource), so the rows belong
    to the calendar rather than to a company of their own, and the copies
    already carry their own. Repointing them moved the original onto the same
    copy the duplicate sits on, leaving the company with the public holiday
    twice - which core's own overlap constraint forbids.
