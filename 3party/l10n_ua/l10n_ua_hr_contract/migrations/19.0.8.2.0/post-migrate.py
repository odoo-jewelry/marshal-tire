"""Merge the three workplace flags into `employment_type_ua`.

`is_main_workplace`, `is_part_time` and `part_time_type` described one thing
between them — whether this employment is the person's primary job or
secondary employment — and could contradict each other while doing it. They
are replaced by a single Selection, and their values are carried over here.

Only a deliberate secondary employment is carried over; everything else stays
on the column default, `primary`. That asymmetry is not caution for its own
sake — `is_main_workplace = FALSE` is not evidence of anything:

    19.0.2.0.0/pre-migrate.py created the column with
    `ALTER TABLE hr_version ADD COLUMN is_main_workplace BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`,
    so every row that existed at that upgrade was stamped FALSE. Its
    post-migrate then set the real value on employees who had an *open*
    `hr_contract_ua`, and only on their current version. Everyone else — past
    versions, employees without a UA contract, employees whose contract was
    closed — kept the FALSE nobody chose. And because the column was created
    by SQL rather than by the ORM, the field's `default=True` never reached
    those rows either.

Reading FALSE as secondary employment would therefore turn whole payroll
histories into external secondary jobs. So the two signals that are actually
deliberate decide instead:

  1. `part_time_type` was NULL by default and is only ever filled in by hand
     (or from a hand-filled UA contract) — it is taken at face value, even
     where `is_main_workplace` is TRUE, because TRUE is what every new version
     gets for free from the field default while nobody picks "Internal
     secondary job" by accident.
  2. `is_part_time = TRUE` together with a cleared main-workplace flag, but no
     type, is NOT carried over. The cleared flag may be nothing but the
     19.0.2.0.0 stamp, and part-time work at the main workplace is not
     secondary employment; guessing `external` would change the person for
     payroll. These rows stay primary and every id is logged for review.

Everything else is left primary, and the count is logged so it can be
reviewed. To see what this will do before upgrading, run on a copy:

    SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE part_time_type IN ('internal','external')) AS explicit,
           count(*) FILTER (WHERE part_time_type IS NULL
                              AND is_part_time IS TRUE
                              AND is_main_workplace IS NOT TRUE)            AS guessed,
           count(*) FILTER (WHERE part_time_type IS NULL
                              AND is_part_time IS NOT TRUE
                              AND is_main_workplace IS NOT TRUE)            AS left_primary
      FROM hr_version;

This runs in post-migrate, not pre-migrate: the new column already exists by
now, while the three old ones are still there. Odoo drops the columns of
fields a module no longer declares only at the very end of the upgrade, once
every module has been loaded (`ir.model.data._process_end`), so both sides of
the mapping are readable at this point and no snapshot table is needed.

Written in SQL rather than through the ORM on purpose: the field is tracked,
and a write would drop a chatter entry into every employee's record. A data
migration is not an event in someone's working life.
