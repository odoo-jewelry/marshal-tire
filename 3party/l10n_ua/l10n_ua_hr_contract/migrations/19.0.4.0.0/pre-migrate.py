"""Guard the removal of hr.work.schedule (#213, phase 2).

Phase 1 (19.0.3.0.0) mapped every `hr.version.work_schedule_ua_id` onto the
native `resource_calendar_id`. Phase 2 deletes the UA models, so this upgrade
must not be the one that also has to perform that mapping: the module code is
already gone by the time 19.0.3.0.0/post-migrate runs, and the versions would
silently fall back to the company default calendar — a different weekly norm,
hence different leave entitlement and payroll.

A database that is behind therefore has to make the two steps separately.
